- Fix weird BIOP protocol stuff?
- Look into what actually requires mapping because there is no way we need to identity map all available RAM
  - Reduce os-loader bump capacity, its now at 64 MiB ...
- Remove MemoryDescriptor import from kernel
  - Also MEMORY_ACPI etc.
- Figure out what to do with memory allocation & mapping in os-loader
- Fix posix tests in physical memory
- Rethink memory allocation for kernel structures in uefi and whether or not to add them to free physical memory in kernel --- definitely some bugs now.
- if you ever decide to use unit tests in the kernel, need to create an abstraction for test-framework so it can be used in both posix and freestanding environments
