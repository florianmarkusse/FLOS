- redo abstractions
- get rid of if xxx for `add_subproject` - each project can just declare their included projects now
- look into recursive inclusions for abstractions?
- remove -i libs?
- ask iwyu crew how to handle platform-abstraction includes? Perhap
- Figure out what to do with memory allocation & mapping in os-loader
- Fix posix tests in physical memory
- Rethink memory allocation for kernel structures in uefi and whether or not to add them to free physical memory in kernel --- definitely some bugs now.
- if you ever decide to use unit tests in the kernel, need to create an abstraction for test-framework so it can be used in both posix and freestanding environments
